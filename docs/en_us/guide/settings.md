### 4.1.3 Working Directory

![4-1-3_1](../../resources/settings/4-1-3_1.png)
![4-1-3_2](../../resources/settings/4-1-3_2.png)
> Note: After changing the working directory, games in the original path will no longer appear in the "Game List." It is recommended to transfer or re-download them. It’s best to change the working directory the first time you open the launcher.
### 4.1.4 Download Settings
- The number of parallel downloads largely determines your download speed, but higher concurrency also brings greater performance overhead.
- If you are not familiar with the meanings of the Minecraft version URL, Modrinth API URL, and Git proxy URL, please do not modify them. Changing them may cause game resources to fail to download.
> If you accidentally changed them, please restore them to their default values. \
> Minecraft version URL: https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest.json \
> Modrinth API URL: https://api.modrinth.com/v2 \
> Git proxy URL: https://ghfast.top

## 4.2 Tabs
